                <strong>Frigadae:</strong><br>
                Art design is somewhat vague and hard to unpack. The general art style is strongly influenced by Deltarune. So we'd like to say it's Undertale with a couple of graphical touch-ups here and there. For environmental art there was really just an overall need to make it feel colder and more remote than Snowdin, so a lot of cold colors were selected, especially blue, indigo and purple tones. For reference materials, a good place to start would be snippets from the film Siberiade.<br><br>
                Since Wildfire is intended to take place way before the time periods of Undertale Yellow and Undertale, looking for pre-internet artifacts as inspiration seems fitting. There was also just an overall want at least for me personally to shine some light onto the more obscure stuff that exists in the real world and in history. So artifacts referenced in the teaser like the Commodore 64 comes into play. The Sopwith Triplane, New Zealand birds like the Kakapo and Kiwi intended for blocking your path in the combat demo is just one out of many things to come.

                <strong>water:</strong><br>
                lots of our overworld cutscenes use cool animation! i would say that we've set our visual polish standard somewhat higher than UNDERTALE's was (i mean, can you even roughly list how many custom animations were used in UNDERTALE's cutscenes past simple in-engine sprite swaps? i can only think of one... monster kid...), so that includes using proper animation in places where it's either necessary for coolness, or just where it's funny. one character in particular is already on-track to be very dense with custom animations, but i won't tell you who... that said though, we have a very talented team of artists and animators, so please have faith in our ability to deliver!

                <strong>python-b5:</strong><br>
                I wasn't the main designer for the Trinkets (that would be Beemo!), so the influence probably doesn't come across particularly strongly, but the Trinkets in our game remind me of CHARMs from OMORI. In fact, other parts of Wildfire's combat system remind me of OMORI as well - our PLAYs are kind of similar to SKILLs in that game! In a way, our combat system combines elements from Undertale, Deltarune, and OMORI, though to varying degrees, of course.

            <p>
                <strong>WildBeemo:</strong><br>
                I was inspired by roguelike games like Slay the Spire, which feature 'Relics' that provide passive benefits, and Jokers from Balatro that have unique effects when added to your run.

                I can't speak on the process Toby uses to develop his games, not being privy to his team's workings, but compared to the code I've read from Undertale and Deltarune I try to keep Wildfire's code well-organized and structured, so it's easy to maintain and to patch out bugs in when they pop up. Combat encounters specifically I have put a lot of work into to make them as easy as possible to create, and require little hardcoding. I made the <a href="https://gist.github.com/python-b5/d6f18f25b404325203cc290ddbd6262f">text</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/python-b5/ba00841236c056486c799a396992ca09">cutscene</a> systems' documentation public a while back, which might help give an idea of the level of planning I like to put into things.

            <p>
                <strong>python-b5:</strong><br>
                It's hard to place something as immaterial as "how hard was it toâ€¦" on a numeric scale like this, but if I have to I'd say somewhere around a 6 or 7. There's certainly a lot to keep track of in a complicated game like Wildfire, but quantity doesn't necessarily equal difficulty. Most of the code in Wildfire isn't really all that complicated. There's no fancy computer science stuff going on, haha. Nothing I've needed to program for Wildfire has been complicated enough that I've ever been genuinely stumped as to how to implement it. It's a 2D pixel art game without any fancy graphical effects - it's best not to overthink things. Sometimes picking the right solution is hard, but putting everything together into a complete game and staying organized is where the actual challenge generally lies. I try my best to design well-architected systems for things so that I don't have to do annoying hardcoding in the future, which can also be tricky since I am admittedly not great at planning things out.<br><br>
                ... oh, and debugging. That can be a pain.
