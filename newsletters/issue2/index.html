                    Happy new year!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today marks the one-year anniversary of Undertale Wildfire's
                    development. January 1st sure is an easy date to remember -
                    the start of the year is the same day that Undertale
                    Wildfire was initially conceptualized. We feel we've come a
                    long way, and it feels good to see all the work we've done. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We're glad to see that people are enjoying our characters -
                    we've seen people excitedly discuss our game, make fanart,
                    and record playthroughs of our Combat Demo. We put a lot of
                    work into it, so seeing people stream themselves playing it
                    and even speedrunning the challenges has been delightful.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now... I'm sure you're just thinking, "Okay, unspecified
                    Undertale Wildfire developer, that's cool and all, but how's
                    development been going?"
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And to you, random inquirer, I shall provide an answer!
                </p>

                    Snowdown, the first area of the game, is still underway. Our
                    artists, writers, composers, and programmers are all making
                    an even pace toward a finished product, and our workflow has
                    been smoothly ironed out and streamlined compared to the
                    first few chaotic months of development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It's been quite the learning process... but we're getting
                    there!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>        
                    All of the rooms for the first of Snowdown's two subareas,
                    the Trail, are fully tiled and in the process of being
                    implemented. There are a few cutscenes and battles that
                    still need spritework done, but all of the concepts for the
                    Trail are complete. We're now starting to work on filling
                    these rooms with lots of interesting things.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some NPCs have been written...
                </p>
                <br>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The puzzles are in progress...
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    And a few of the basic encounters are finished, as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img class="image" src="images/grimmageReflectionAttack.gif" alt="An attack from a monster named Grimmage. The battle box is split in two, with the SOUL on one side and its reflection on the other. Halfway through the attack, the two switch places.">

                    Grimmage isn't actually in the Trail... but this attack
                    looks super cool, doesn't it?!
                </i></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our musicians have also been working hard! Here's one of the
                    new tracks you'll hear in the Trail - see if you can
                    recognize the melody:

                <p>
                    So, that's where progress stands for Snowdown right now. The
                    rest of Snowdown's rooms are already conceptualized, and the
                    Forest is currently on the tiling block. Essentially, we're
                    just putting all of our ideas into a tangible form.

                <p>
                    Writing-wise, we have a few things left we're fine-tuning in
                    Snowdown. This includes tasks like looking over and editing
                    cutscene dialogue, figuring out bits of flavor text here and
                    there, workshopping our jokes (please take the microphone
                    away from Beemo), and getting non-plot related NPCs
                    designed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Since everything major is done regarding Snowdown, we've
                    also made some decent headway into the game's next area.
                    We've got the room layout for its first subarea finished,
                    concept art for how we want it to be tiled and colored, the
                    important characters fleshed out, and so on. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ah, you want something a little more specific...? I suppose
                    we can give a tiny tease. The random encounter monster
                    designs for the next area past Snowdown have been
                    workshopped and finalized. We think they look pretty neat,
                    and we're looking forward to nailing down their bullet
                    patterns and flavor text soon.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Well, there you have it - things are happening, and our
                    workflow has improved as we've learned what works best with
                    our team. There were various rough patches throughout the
                    year, but we've finished fooling and found our footing, as
                    they say!
