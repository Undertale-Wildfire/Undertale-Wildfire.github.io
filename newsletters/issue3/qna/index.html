                Question for Riley- did you know any of the previous fallen
                children before you, do some monsters talk about how close they
                were to them before their souls were taken?<br>

                Hey Riley, I've always wondered, you've lived in the underground
                for quite some time, what was it like when you first arrived
                there? How did you manage? And are there any monsters you feel
                indebted to, for helping you adjust, without them knowing what
                you are?<br>
