                    It's the start of another new year, which means Undertale
                    Wildfire is celebrating its second anniversary!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    2025 was a great year, not only for Undertale Wildfire, but
                    for the Undertale and Deltarune fandom as a whole. Like most
                    of you (if not all of you!), we too played Chapters 3 & 4
                    when they were released in the middle of the year. Suffice
                    to say, not only were they highly enjoyable to play after so
                    many years of eager anticipation, but they helped inspire
                    and shape our own work as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While we haven't released anything playable in the past
                    year, rest assured that we're all still working hard on the
                    game. Over the course of 2025, we've released a few updates
                    and teasers to you all. There's been music, fights, and even
                    a letter from an interesting individual...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    ... seriously, though, when Mr. Sunshine appeared in the
                    anniversary stream? A collective mixture of "What, that's so
                    cool!!" and "Toby, c'mon, we're doing something with this
                    guy now!!" was felt among the team. For those unaware, Mr.
                    Sunshine originated as an unused enemy design that appeared
                    in the Undertale artbook. Guess he's sorta used now, huh?
                    But, as an Old Man once put it: others can always step up,
                    take the pen, and write their own stories. We're happy to
                    see Toby ultimately implement the unused enemy in his own
                    way, and we're still excited to bring our own interpretation
                    to the design and breathe life into it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Which brings us to: Wildfire's progress!

                <h1>PROGRESS: OVERWORLD</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At this point last year, we were still working on creating
                    assets for and mapping out the overworld. But now? Snowdown
                    is <strong>100% tiled</strong>! All rooms (even the <span
                    class="dim">[REDACTED]</span> room where <span class="dim">
                    [REDACTED]</span> happens) are fully designed and in-engine,
                    and many are populated with game content as well. Pretty
                    neat, huh? Take a look at one of the locations you'll get to
                    explore in Snowdown - the Stairway Tree:

                <h1>PROGRESS: BATTLES</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As we said in our first newsletter, we're aiming for
                    Undertale Wildfire to have a stronger focus on combat than
                    the original game did. That means we've been working on lots
                    of enemy and boss encounters over the past year! Now,
                    battles - especially bullet patterns - take time to do
                    properly, and so not all of them are complete yet. However,
                    our random encounters are all playable, and some minibosses
                    and bosses are complete as well. Check out this funky guy
                    you'll be groovin' with in Snowdown:

                <br>
                <p>
                    Undertale's charm isn't just in its battles and touching
                    moments, but also in the setpieces, puzzles, cutscenes, and
                    <span class="dim">FUN</span> events scattered throughout the
                    game. We're slowly but surely chipping away at content in
                    all of these departments. Much of this is simple flavor text
                    or chit-chat between characters, but there are more
                    elaborate events as well; some might be more akin to, shall
                    we say, getting a good cardio workout:

                    You may have seen us share a small form to fill out in
                    December, in which you could ask questions to Undertale
                    Wildfire's various characters. Well, we showed your
                    questions to some of the fine folk of Snowdown, and here's
                    what they had to say:

                    We'd like to thank everyone for their patience. We know
                    that, between the Combat Demo and our occasional teasers
                    over the last year, you're all eager to see the demo
                    completed and finally play through Snowdown. Trust us, we
                    want to get Snowdown out to you all too! While we can't
                    commit to a release date quite yet, we're hoping to finish,
                    test, and release the Snowdown demo sometime this year.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    That said, the team as a whole is still quite active. The
                    smaller, more numerous bits of writing, like item flavor
                    text and NPC dialogue, are complete for Snowdown. The story
                    scenes for each route in the second area of the game beyond
                    Snowdown are all fully written as well (albeit under
                    possible future scrutiny). Some art and tiling for the
                    second area is also underway. The writing team's current
                    focus is on fleshing out and writing the third area of the
                    game. We're really excited about some of the stuff you'll
                    get to see when the full game releases! It's just
                    unfortunate that it will be years until then. Sometimes we
                    think we must feel like Toby does, with everything his team
                    has been working on for Deltarune but has to keep behind
                    locked doors for the time being.

                    Well, thank you for reading! To be fully transparent, we
                    likely won't share anything else major about Snowdown until
                    the release of the demo. So, we hope this newsletter is
                    enough to tide you over until the demo is in your hands.
